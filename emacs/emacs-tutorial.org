| =C-x C-c=          | =save-buffers-kill-terminal= | End the Emacs session                                                                                 |
| =C-g=              | =keyboard-quit=              | Quit a partially entered command                                                                      |
| =C-z (or C-x C-z)= | =suspend-frame=              | Do whatever is right to suspend the current frame                                                     |

| =C-v=              | =scroll-up-command=          | Move forward one screenful (*overlap of 2 lines* to provide some continuity)                          |
| =M-v=              | =scroll-down-command=        | Move backward one screenful                                                                           |
| =C-l=              | =recenter-top-bottom=        | Clear screen and redisplay all the text, moving the text aroud the cursor to the center of the screen |

- (You can also use =<PageUp>= and =<PageDn>= to move screenful)
- (You can also use the arrow keys to move point)

- =C-x C-c= is the right key to use when about to log out or ending a quick edit (e.g., with filename as argument to Emacs)

- With numeric prefix ARG, =C-l= move current line to window-line ARG

- Normally, the last line in a file will have a Newline character at the end, but Emacs does not require it
- =C-b= and =C-f= move accross the Newline character

- When the cursor move past the top or bottom of the screen, the text beyond the edge shfts onto the screen \rightarrow /Scrolling/

- When you are in the middle of a word, =M-f= moves to the end of the word
- When you are in whitespace between words, =M-f= moves to te end of the following word
- =M-b= works likewise in the opposite direction

- Very often *Meta characters* are used for operations related to the *units defined by language* (words, sentences, paragraphs), while *Control characters* operate on *basic units* that are independent of what you are editing (characters, lines, etc)
